# Introduction

This is a reimplementation of the [EmberJS Starting Guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started) but written in Coffeescript -- version 1.7.0 to be exact.

## Why?

I have been wanting to learn [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com) and [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and combining the two seemed like a good idea.

I have tried to stay true and accurate to the starting guide with regards to
steps, naming, and implementation.  You can view the original source files on
the [original quick start code sample](https://github.com/emberjs/quickstart-code-sample).

The compiled Javascript files are checked in alongside the Coffeescript files.

## Disclaimer

I am not a Emberjs expert.  I am not a Coffeescript expert.:

I rewrote all the examples by hand, so there may be slight discrepancies.  I'm a
big fan of actually typing tutorials out in an example project; it forces you to
get your environment setup and more importantly, how to debug typoos.

## Coffeescript

I am using vim with Coffeescript support.  Here's my [vim's dotfile changes](https://github.com/rpond-pa/vimfiles/commit/296d4570381c2499b6748a9b90e5b229e436ae37) where I add Coffeescript support.  This is currently setup to compile the Coffeescript files when saved and to display compile errors in a quick window.

## Fin

Enjoy.  Hope this helps.
